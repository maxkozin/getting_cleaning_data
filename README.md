## Task

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Files

1. run_analysis.R - an R script performs all transformations of the data
2. CodeBook.md   - a code book describes the variables, the data, and all transformations performed to clean up the data
3. tidy_data.txt - a tidy dataset that is the result of the 5th step of the task.
